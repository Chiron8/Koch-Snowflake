# Koch Snowflake Generator

## Intro

This generator is written in Python and uses PIL to create the image. The koch snowflake is a fractal created by drawing an equilateral triangle then adding another triangle to each of the sides and remove the line where they intersect

## Usage
To use this you first need to install the correct packages : `pip install pillow`

`resolution` controls the width and height of the image
`quality` controls how many times the algorithm is repeated
